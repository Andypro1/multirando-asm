get script to copy byte range into new file


ring/tunic subroutine:
[0x8E, 0x02, 0x06, 0x8E, 0x72, 0x06, 0xEE, 0x4F, 0x03, 0x60]
STX $0602   ;  Duplicating the overwritten code (writing #$02)
STX $0672   ;  Copying [X (#$02)] to $0672 also (tunic palette maybe? rammap dunnos)
INC $034f   ;  Enemies killed on current screen (...)
RTS

byte-compare a z1r seed with Z.nes to see if there is a patch in bank 1 in a similar spot to HandleClass2, etc.

8e 02 06 8e 72 06 ee 4f 03 60  - z1r has same tunic sub as above.  hmm.

20 e4 ff  z1r hook in exact same spot too..
The code does not seem to have anything to do with palettes or tunics or anything.
** Code runs on Ganon kill.  Makes more sense - it must be some type of ganon bugfix patch.

Create a patch from a vanilla rom change and apply it to a changed rom (different rando seed; whatever)

***  Bank_1_Code starts in SAVE RAM AT 006C90!!, not at 0x8000 where the rest of the swapped banks start
test offsets.
@Take is (in theory) offset 066d.  66d + 6c90 = 72fd (or add 010 for header offset)
TakeItem: code starts with:  a2 08 8e 02 06 c9 0e
Located at ABE0 in "bank 1 8000 offset",
which is   6bf0 in the full rom
which is   6be0 without the header
so subtract 4000 from the offsets in https://www.computerarcheology.com/NES/Zelda/Bank1.html
