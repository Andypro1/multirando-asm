CF - Unused (Reserved for Z1 internal use)

10 unused items (outside Z1)
11 unused items (inside Z1)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Due to item id layout in Z1, we use the internal item id:s in that game from
0x00-0x2F for it's own items, and start custom items at an offset of 0x30.

This means that any item after CF is off-limits for any game besides Z1, since
we won't be able to assign them in that game. So we need to put the custom Z1
items here.

This leaves space at 0x24-0x2E in Z1 for new items, as well as any other free
slot in the 0x00-0xCF range.

Right now we want to reserve 0xCF as well since that maps to 0xFF in Z1 and has
special properties. But worst case we can probably fix that.

If there are items we know we'll never place in Z1, it's safe to put it here
as well.
